# CodePerformanceAnalysis

This Python code demonstrates how to capture an image from the default camera of the computer, apply image processing using OpenCV, and display the processed image on the screen.

# Installation

1. Install Python 3.x from the official website.
2. Install OpenCV by running the following command in the terminal:
```
pip install opencv-python
```

# Usage

1. Run the Python code using a Python interpreter or an IDE.
2. The code captures an image from the default camera, flips the image horizontally using OpenCV's flip() function, and displays the flipped image on the screen.
3. The code also measures the execution time of the code block using the time module and prints the time taken to execute the code block.
